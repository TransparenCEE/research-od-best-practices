          <p>In order to learn more about the influence of technology on the everyday work of journalists, we talked to regional NGOs that do investigative journalism. Among the most prominent of them are: Balkan Investigative Reporting Network - Macedonia, Atlatszo.hu and the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP). We asked them to share with us experience and tips on how regional NGOs can adapt and thrive with the increasing pace of technological advance- ment.</p>
          <p>We did not aim to cover all possible aspects of how technology impacts journalism. Instead we focused on personal, practical, first-hand experience of high-level professionals in thefield. For this purpose we conducted series of in-depth interviews with 15 open-ended, semi-structured ques- tions.</p>
          <p>The questions covered three specific areas: (1) The ways technology influences content production, (2) The ways technology influences the journalistic skills, and (3) The ways technology influences the impact of stories.</p>
